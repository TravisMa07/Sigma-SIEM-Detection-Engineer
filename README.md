# Sigma-SIEM-Detection-Engineer
This project involves designing and implementing custom Sigma detection rules to identify common adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The Sigma rules are translated into optimized queries for Elastic SIEM to detect real-world attacks and malicious behaviors. The project demonstrates an end-to-end detection engineering workflow, from threat emulation through rule tuning and deployment within security operations environments.
